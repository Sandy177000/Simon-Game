# Simon-Game
The Simon Game is a memory-based game where players test their ability to remember and reproduce a sequence of colors. The game consists of a circular game board with four colored buttons: green, red, yellow, and blue.

To play the game, the player starts by pressing the "Start" button. The game then generates a random pattern of colors by lighting up the buttons in a specific sequence. Each button lights up one at a time, and the player must remember the sequence.

Once the pattern is displayed, it's the player's turn to reproduce it. They do so by clicking on the colored buttons in the same order as the pattern they just saw. For example, if the pattern was green, red, yellow, the player must click the green button, then the red button, and finally the yellow button.

If the player reproduces the pattern correctly, they advance to the next level, and the game generates a longer pattern. The player's progress is displayed on the screen, usually as the current level.

However, if the player makes a mistake and clicks the buttons in the wrong order, the game ends, and they have the option to restart.

The challenge of the Simon Game lies in remembering and reproducing longer and more complex patterns as the player progresses through the levels. It tests the player's concentration, memory, and ability to stay focused under pressure.

The game includes audio and visual effects to provide feedback to the player, such as sounds and animations when buttons light up or when the player makes a mistake.

The Simon Game is a fun and engaging way to challenge and improve your memory skills while enjoying a simple yet addictive gameplay experience.
